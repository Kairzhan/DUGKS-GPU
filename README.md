## Installation

To compile the code installation of the [NVIDIA HPC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk) is required. The code was developed on a workstation with NVIDIA HPC SDK version 22.3. For visualization purposes one may use [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) or [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/). Some postprocessing scripts require [Python3](https://python.org).

Repository contains two versions of the code: single-GPU CUDA-Fortran version and Multi-GPU CUDA-C version. The CUDA-C version also can be used in single GPU run.

To compile the codes tweak appropriate Makefiles and run commands `make clean` followed by `make`. By default executable is named `main`. 

## Usage

After compiling the codes use the following command to run simulation using CUDA-C version:

```
mpirun -np 2 ./main
```

where it is assumed that computer has two GPUs and code will automatically use both GPUs through MPI parallelization.
